# Phone Detection

This work is to train a machine learning to detect a phone in an image by given a dataset of the images. The experiment in this work has been conducted in Ubuntu version 20.04.4 LTS with Intel® Xeon(R) CPU E5-1630 v4 @ 3.70GHz × 8 processor and NVIDIA Corporation GP104 [GeForce GTX 1080] GPU. 

This repository mainly includes 4 files:

1) train.ipynb: This is a notebook for training a machine learning model.
2) train_phone_finder.py: This is a script training a machine learning model.
3) find_phone.py: This is a script to use the machine learning model trained by one of the previous files to locate a phone in a given image.
4) requirement.txt: This is to install required Python modules for the notebook and scripts.
